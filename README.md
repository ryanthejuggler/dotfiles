#dotfiles

My personally-curated dotfiles

##Bootstrapping

Two-step install:

1. `git clone https://github.com/ryanthejuggler/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles`
1. `.dotfiles/bootstrap.sh`

This will get you 90% of the way there. For the other 10% see the notes on **Vim**.

##Files included

 * `.vimrc` Vim setup
   * Note: You'll need to run `:BundleInstall` after opening up Vim.
 * `.tmux.conf` Tmux setup
 * `.zshrc` Zsh setup
